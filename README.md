# Msg-Encoding-Decoding

A message encoding and decoding project in Python using the base64 library typically involves creating a program 
that can encode plain text messages into base64 format and decode base64 encoded messages back into their original 
plain text form. 
Designed and implemented a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for encoding and decoding 
messages. The application uses the base64 library to perform the encoding and decoding operations, allowing users 
to input a message and a key for encryption or decryption
